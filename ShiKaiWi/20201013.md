## Plan
- reading malloc.go

## Notes
### hierachy
        +-----------------------------------------+
 mheap  |            A run of mspans.             |
        +-----------------------------------------+
                                                   
        +-----------------+     +-----------------+
mcentral|mspans for Size0 | *** |mspans for Size70|
        +-----------------+     +-----------------+
                                                   
        +------------------+   +------------------+
 mcache |mspans for thread0|***|mspans for thread0|
        +------------------+   +------------------+

Use mcache first and then use mcentral for lack of mspans in the mcache and use mheap finally if all miss when allocating small objects(<=32KB).
Use mheap directly if allocation a large objects.

### virtual memory layout
The heap consists of a set of arenas who consists of a heapArena and a set of mspan.

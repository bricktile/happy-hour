## Plan
60min: GFS

## Notes
### Why hard?
- performance => sharding
- faults => tolerance by replication
- inconsistency because of replication 
- low performance because of consistency 

### What?
#### Consitency
strong consistency ensures client interactes with cluster(many machines) just like with single matchine.

#### Replication
- double write: update disorder(inconsistency).

### How is GFS built?
#### Features
- Automatic Recovery
- Single data center
- Storing Large file
- For sequential access
- no gurantee for correct data

#### Archtecture 
- Single master keeps meta data for all chunks located in chunk servers.
- Multiple chunk servers take responsibility for storing chunks whose size is 64MB based on linux filesystem.

#### Read/Write procedure
check these procedure in paper or the course vedio.

#### Shortcomings
- single master => no ha of master
- no strong onsistency gurantee

#### Interesting Q&A
(check answers in next note)
1. why do all replica need a primary?
2. why to keep primary role by leasing?
3. why to use heartbeat to grant a lease of primary?

#### Conclusion
(check them in next note)
